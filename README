Gorilla Builder

This module brings a flexible API to Drupal to facilitate Mailchimp development.
It's build on top of the MCAPI PHP class. It features a set of functions you can 
use in your own module. The API features error handling, watchdog integration and
a limited UI.

Why?

One day, I had to push content from Drupal to MC. Rather then sending plain nodes or
importing from an URL, I had to aggregate content embedded with MC's smart tags. There
were no modules out there able to do that so I had to build it myself. I realized that a
lot of stuff I've build were monkeyjobs I would probably have to redo at some point. I split 
them off into Gorilla Builder. So, don't be a monkey and start using this in your MC projects.

Roadmap?

I conceived this in a spur of a moment thing. No real battle plans so far. Other then
getting the stuff I need up and running. The big idea is to build a core API module and
spawn a few side modules from there. 

Todo's:

* Writing tests
* Extend the API to a flexible framework: GorillaCampaign, GorillaList,... classes
* Views integration
* Documentation

Suggestions so far:

* A pluggable content/template integrator
* Managing cronjobs
* Rules integration
* ...

How to use?

This is really, really unstable code. Barely ready to toy around. Beware!
